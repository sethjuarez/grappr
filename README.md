This is the code I will use to demo basic AI techniques. Feel free to have a look-see!

## Plans
1. **Uninformed search** (BFS, DFS, Uniform-Cost, Depth-Limited, Iterative Deepening DFS)
2. **Informed (Heuristic) Search** (Greedy Best First, A*)
3. **Adversarial Search** (Minimax, Alpha-Beta)

## Reality
I am guessing I will probably get only part of that done in the next couple of weeks.
